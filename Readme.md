# Offline Capability

One of the main motivations of making this app was making it accessible to most people at most places. That's why we opted to make this app available fully offline. To make this feature possible we used many native modules instead of libraries as most of them use cloud based functionality for the most part. We wrote modules for speech recognition, text-to-speech, shake detection etc. We even went out of our way to make it possible to track your location without an internet connection.

# Voice Control

As stated earlier to make this app accessible to most people we implemented voice control functionality for the people who dont have the perfect vision. Every gesture that can be handled with touch also has a voice command for it. For reading all the voice commands go to [Voice Commands](https://github.com/Aman-in-GitHub/Rakshya-KUHackfest2023/blob/main/voicecommands.md).

# Location Tracking

For offline location tracking we use the GPS of the phone to get the current longitude and latitude of the user and using various algorithms we tend to use that info in various places throughout our app like showing the user the closed hospitals/medicals to them with contact info and directions.

Note: To get directions to the health centres nearby while offline download the offline Google Maps of your local area.

# First Aid

We researched the web for the most common accidents that require first aid, we scraped the aid for those accidents and converted them in a more user-friendly format in order to provide the users the best experience in their difficult times. We have the aid for accidents ranging from bee stings all the way to life threatning incidents like heart attack.

# Emergency SOS

With just a slight jerk to your app, we activate the panic mode and your current location with an SOS message to your pre defined contacts that are asked to you during the initial setup.
