It will help to lessen the likelihood of shock if you can
elevate your legs or position your head lower than your trunk.
If you are helping someone else, check their breathing and
circulation before proceeding. If you suspect the person you are
helping is in shock, seek medical attention or call emergency
services right away.

Step-2: Elevate the wounded part\n
Raising the wounded part (assuming it is an extremity that is
injured) above the heart will help to reduce severe bleeding. If
you suspect a broken bone, however, do not attempt to move the
part.

Step-3: Remove any debris from the wound\n
Clean up any visible foreign body and dirt, but do not clean the
wound thoroughly as this can aggravate the wound. Your immediate
priority is to stop severe bleeding. Cleaning the wound can
wait. If the foreign object is large, however (e.g., a large
piece of glass, a knife, or similar), do not remove it. It is
most likely stopping a lot of the bleeding itself. Just put
pressure on the area around the object, taking care not to push
it in further.

Step-4: Apply firm pressure directly to the wound until the
bleeding stops\n
Use a pad of clean gauze, dressing, or clothing. Even your hand
can work if nothing else is available. Place your hand over the
pad and apply firm pressure to the wound with your fingers or a
hand.

Step-5: Apply pressure steadily\n
If the injury is on a limb, you can use tape or a cloth wrapped
around the wound to maintain pressure (a folded triangular bandage
placed over the wound and tied is ideal). For injuries to the
groin or other parts of the body where you cannot wrap the wound,
use a heavy pad and keep using your hands to press on the wound.

Step-6: Look for seepage from the wound\n
Add more gauze or additional bandages if the original soaks
through. Do not over-wrap it, however, as increased bulk risks
reducing pressure on the wound. If you suspect the bandage is not
working, remove the bandage and pad and reassess the
application. If the bleeding appears controlled, maintain
pressure until you are sure the bleeding has stopped or medical
help has arrived.

Step-7: Use pressure points, if necessary\n
If you cannot stop the bleeding by pressure alone, combine using
direct pressure to the wound with pressure to one of these
pressure points. Use your fingers to press the blood vessel
against the bone. The most commonly needed pressure points are
described below: The brachial artery, for wounds on the lower arm.
Runs on the inside of the arm between the elbow and armpit. The
femoral artery, for thigh wounds. Runs along the groin near the
bikini line. The popliteal artery, for wounds on the lower leg.
This is found behind the knee.

Step-8: Continue applying pressure until the bleeding stops or
help arrives\n
Do not stop applying pressure unless you are certain the bleeding
has stopped. If blood is not obviously soaking through the
dressing, check the wound occasionally to see if it is still
bleeding. Do not apply pressure to an artery for longer than 5
minutes after the bleeding has stopped. Use a tourniquet if the
bleeding is life-threatening. Tourniquets usually stop bleeding
instantly if applied correctly, but incorrect tourniquet use can
harm the patient.

Step-9: Monitor the victimâ€™s breathing\n
Check that the bandages are not too tight. If the victim has cold,
pale skin, toes or fingers that do not restore to normal color
after compression, or the victim complains of numbness or
tingling, it is probable that the bandaging is too tight.`;
